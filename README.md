### Problem:

After the transition to online learning due to COVID-19, a lot of lower income schools, particularly middle and high schools, have been impacted negatively largely due to not having a set online platform for students. These schools particularly can not afford specific platforms like Blackboard or Canvas. So, schools have been using emails, zoom, Microsoft Teams etc to make up for this, however, these come with their own set of issues such as not being personalized to a school, technical problems/difficulties etc.

### Solution:

A free or low-cost alternative to learning management systems like Blackboard. This would be personalised (to a specific degree) to each school. Technical support teams would also work directly with each school to provide a personalised experience. Initial trainings would be included free of cost to familiarize students and teachers to the interface as well.
